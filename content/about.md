This is Rye_Catcher's second blog, which is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on [Azure's static web app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/).

You can go to my [another blog](https://rye-catcher.github.io/). Latest posts covered a wide range of topics, but previous posts are mainly about competitive programming.

Now I'm a year 1 computer science student in NUS (National University of Singapore). I learnt some competitive programming stuff in my high school and love to discover cool things.

Btw, my previous nickname is `Rye_Catcher`, which is from Salinger's novel _The Catcher in the Rye_.  Now I often use `Rat` or `R4t`  as my nickname, which is from Haruki Murakami's novels: _the Trilogy of the Rat_. That explains the domain and the blog's name.

If you want to say anything or make a friend with me (I'm quite loved to do so), pls write somewhere in the comments in this blog or tell me directly (if you somehow find a way to do so)

Hope you enjoy reading and find what you seek for :)
